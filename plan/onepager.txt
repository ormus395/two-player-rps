A two player rock paper scissors game

people go to the site and are met with a landing
the landing will have the ability to create a lobby and a username,
or enter a room name to enter an existing lobby

person creating the lobby will have the ability to set game rules
the game rules are: rounds and pick time
after selecting these the lobby is created with a room name, that they can send to a friend

other person joins the lobby, 
the lobby has a two player limit, and only two plaeyers can join the lobby
once the players join, the lobby owner can then start the game

the game process works by allowing each person to pick either Rock Paper or scissors
they also have a set amount of time to do this, so a timer should be shown
letting the players know how much time they have left

each round is evaluated for a winner and a loser
a score is kept, and after all the rounds, the winner is announced and the game ends
